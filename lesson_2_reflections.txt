What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a hidden folder called .git that then starts tracking changes (commits). All the commits/file changes (emtadata) is stored in this folder.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temporary area that allows you to decide which files you want to commit to the repository. Allows you to selectively choose the files you want to track changes to.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using git status, can see what changes have been made, and which are not yet committed. Can run git diff as well.
